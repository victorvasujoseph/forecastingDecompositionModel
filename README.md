Forecasting with Decomposition Models

Let's perform the decomposition and forecasting together using the ARIMA model for forecasting the Google stock prices. We'll decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and then use the ARIMA model to forecast future values.

# Step-by-Step Guide

1.  Loading and Preprocessing Data: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and indexed by the date column.
2.  Decomposing the Time Series: The seasonal_decompose function is used to decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
3.  Plotting ACF and PACF: These plots help identify the order of the ARIMA model by showing the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation of the residuals.
4.  Fitting the ARIMA Model: The ARIMA model is fit to the residuals. Here, (5, 1, 0) is used as an example; you should choose the order based on ACF and PACF plots.
5.  Forecasting: The model is used to forecast the residuals for the next 90 days.
6.  Combining Forecasts: The forecasted residuals are combined with the last observed trend and seasonal components to get the final forecasted values.
7.  Plotting the Forecast: The forecast and its confidence interval are plotted along with the last year of observed data.
8.  Residual Analysis: The residuals of the ARIMA model are plotted to check for any remaining structure.


# Summary

By decomposing the time series and using the ARIMA model to forecast the residuals, we can capture both the systematic and random components of the time series. This approach provides a more accurate and comprehensive forecast by leveraging the strengths of both decomposition and ARIMA modeling.
